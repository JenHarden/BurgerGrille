## Description

This is a full stack application that allows a user to add a burger to be devoured,
with all of the data being stored on a MySQL database.  When a burger is added, using 
the "Your burger" submission form, it is added to the available burger column on the 
left.  The burger can be devoured by clicking on the burger button to the right on 
the burger.  When a burger is devoured, it moves to the burgers eaten column on the 
right.  If the user wishes to trash the burger, there is a trash button available which
will remove the burger from the MySQL database.
